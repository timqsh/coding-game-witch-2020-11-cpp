(done) Simple bfs with big structure in dict

[debug]
(done) get input from game (cin->cerr) -> python script -> debug with "< input.txt"
(done) profile bfs (gprof)
api -> get timeouts

[optimise bfs]
(done) vector->array
(done) witch.casts -> witch.can_cast + witch.learned
(done) can_cast & learned array<bool> -> bitmask
(done) int -> uint_16 (uint_8 is char...)
(done) map -> unordered_map (maybe hash combine from boost)
(done) optimise search for best path after bfs
(done) allocate queue and dict once (to fix timeouts)
(not needed) more timer checks inside loop (to fix timeouts)
(done) inline struct constructors and assignment operators
(done) 2 dicts -> 1 dict and action in witch
move semantics / less allocations

[strategy]
(done) multicast in bfs
(done) learn in bfs
(not optimal) don't stop bfs on fastest brew -> return all paths -> choose by price
(done) add brews, score, turns (and maybe learns) to state -> don't stop on first brew
(done) diminishing 10% per turn
(done) inventory value sum(inv[1:])
(worse) maybe don't learn in bfs at all
(worse) maybe learn more at start
maybe learn less at start

smart learn (profit estimate, blue generation)
